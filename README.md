Fluorescence is an application for making generative shader art and GPU driven simulations. It uses a custom text-based project format (".flr") which declares structures, buffers, and shaders, along with the sequence of GPU tasks performed each frame. 

The application is built on top of my rendering engine, [Althea](https://github.com/nithinp7/Althea).

## Demo Projects

More demo projects, screenshots, and proper documentation for the ".flr" format to come.
