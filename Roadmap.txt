FLUORESCENCE ROADMAP:
- compute / shading graphs
- focus on 2d for now

graph concept:
- define resources
- define shaders, that declare resource usage
- define shader execution order, left-to-right
- exact stages determined by resource usage...
- 

Graph UI:
- Nodes, layouts, bezier curve connectors
- Grid-alignments?
- 2d node-colliders
- basic 2d springs in layout manager
- .flr projects
