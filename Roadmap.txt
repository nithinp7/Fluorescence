FLUORESCENCE ROADMAP:

Current State:
- Simple .flr file format
- Can specify struct defs, resource declarations, constants
- Can declare compute shaders, organize dispatches, issue barriers
- Can specify display passes, that uses the same resources 

Upcoming:
- CTRL + O: better open-project / create new project dialogue
- Need portfolio of simple practice / demo projects!
- Ideas: mandelbrot set, simple uniform grid particle collision system, flocking sim 
- Fluid sim, SPH, diffusion-reaction sim, etc!

Other TODOs:
- Improved generated file caching
- Allow for reload of flr file? CTRL+SHIFT+R ??


- compute / shading graphs
- focus on 2d for now


Backlog:
- integration with vscode??

graph concept:
- define resources
- define shaders, that declare resource usage
- define shader execution order, left-to-right
- exact stages determined by resource usage...
- 

Graph UI:
- Nodes, layouts, bezier curve connectors
- Grid-alignments?
- 2d node-colliders
- basic 2d springs in layout manager
- .flr projects
