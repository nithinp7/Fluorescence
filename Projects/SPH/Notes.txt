SPH IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

TILING SCHEME IDEAS:
- would be nice if tiles didn't have to hold fixed-size buckets
- 2-pass solution with pre-sizing tiles by pseudo-inserting particles
- second pass atomically allocates tiles. Sets of tile allocs can be done with single 
  atomic operation with wave intrinsics

GENERAL OUTLINE
- predictor-corrector approach
- advect velocity and positions with external forces --> predicted velocity
- Pack resulting positions into tiles (see tiling scheme notes above)
Once packed into tiles...
- Pass to compute local density estimate for each particles
- Pass to determine pressure (for EOS might be able to combine with next step)
- Pass to determine acceleration due to pressure
- Finally apply acceleration to predicted velocity --> final velocity 

RESOURCE LAYOUT
- need to experiment and determine which of these steps can be quantized, compressed etc 
- density, pressure, acceleration
