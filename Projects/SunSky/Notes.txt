PAPER:
Precomputed Atmospheric Scattering
 Eric Bruneton, Fabrice Neyret

Concepts:
-  "At each point, the proportion of light that is scattered θ de
grees away from its incident direction is given by the prod
uct of a scattering coefficient βs and of a phase function P"

- This is kind of like a BRDF "proportion of light from wi reflected in direction of wo
- In fact, isotropic BRDFs could be parameterized with just an angle as well?
- Why is it split into a coefficient and a phase function? Maybe the phase function is generic / "reusable" and the coeff is specific to the medium?
